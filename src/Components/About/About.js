                    <p>For students graduating with a Bachelorâ€™s of technology degree in computer science and engineering (CSE), a specialization or a minor in a subject like business administration, artificial intelligence, or Internet of Things can set them apart in a crowded field of recent graduates. Earning an honors distinction can also help students land a good job. However, very few students were pursuing extra credits. Conducting additional classwork for the credits required for minor programs or honors was often challenging considering the logistics related to transportation and access of University resources, both physical and human resources, after hours. The options for elective courses were limited, and it was often difficult to fit the additional courses into their schedules. </p>
